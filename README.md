# CRUD And Authentication Users NodeJS on Serverless Framework Node HTTP API on AWS

This is a base project for user authentication, connection validation and also logout, likewise, it has some permissions modules according to the user to access the CRUD by assigning, such as the administrator, manager or programmer.

### Create tables in DynamoDB on AWS

In the structure of the project we find a folder called data, if you enter this folder, you will find scripts in nodeJS to create each of the tables for this example, which is configured in your AWS cloud, you can configure it in the code fragment:

```bash
...
AWS.config.update({
  region: 'us-east-1',  // Reemplaza con tu regi√≥n de AWS
  accessKeyId: 'TU_ACCESS_KEY_ID',  // Reemplaza con tu access key ID

});
....
```

```bash

node nameScripts.js
